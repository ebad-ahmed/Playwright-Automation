**Playwright-Automation for Swag Labs Demo Website**

Description:

This project automates tests for the Sauce Labs demo website (https://www.saucedemo.com/) using Playwright and Python Behave. It provides a framework for writing BDD-style (Behavior-Driven Development) tests that are clear, concise, and maintainable.

Installation:

Clone the repository: 

Bash
git clone https://github.com/ebad-ahmed/Playwright-Automation.git
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:

Bash
cd Playwright-Automation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Note: Make sure you have Playwright and Python Behave installed globally or within a virtual environment.

Running Tests:

Start a browser session (optional):

If you want to see the tests running visually, you can start a browser session using Playwright's chromium, firefox, or webkit launchers:

Bash
npx playwright launch
Use code with caution.
Run Behave tests:

Bash
behave features
Use code with caution.
Project Structure:

features/: Contains Behave feature files that define the test scenarios.
steps/: Contains Python step definitions that implement the logic for each step in the features.
pages/ (optional): May contain page object models (POMs) if your project utilizes them for better organization.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python dependencies for the project.
README.md: This file (the one you're creating).
BDD with Playwright and Behave:

This project leverages Behave for BDD-style testing. Behave uses Gherkin, a human-readable language, to define test scenarios in feature files. These features are then mapped to Python step definitions that implement the actual test logic using Playwright for browser automation.

Additional Notes:

Consider adding environment variables to store sensitive information like usernames and passwords. You can use tools like dotenv to manage environment variables.
You can provide example feature files and step definitions to illustrate how to write BDD tests for the Sauce Labs website.
If you're using page object models (POMs), document their structure and purpose.
Include any additional setup or configuration steps required for running the tests.
By incorporating these elements, you'll create a clear, informative, and valuable README file that effectively guides users on how to set up, run, and contribute to your Playwright-Automation project.
